To view (HTML) files can be [read directly](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-tests/).

The index.html files are built using a Ruby tool-chain based on the corresponding manifest.ttl files. Update using `rake`. Requires Ruby, rdf-turtle and json-ld gems to be installed.

Currently, the test suites for RDF ([rdf/](rdf/)) and SPARQL ([sparql/](sparql/)) are jointly managed by the [RDF Tests Community Group] and the [RDF & SPARQL Working Group].
