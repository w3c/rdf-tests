## /rdf-tests/sparql11

This area is the communities group work up to February 2023 when the tests were
reorganised to give a better, future-proof naming scheme.

SPARQL test are in [`/rdf-tests/sparql`](../sparql). This area is left to smooth
the transition to the new arrangement and will be archived at some future date.

The tests here are `data-r2` (SPARQL 1.0 - The Data Access Working Group - DAWG) and `data-sparql11` (SPARQL
1.1 Working Group).

The new area names `data-r2` as [`sparql10`](../sparql/sparql10) and
`data-sparql11` as [`sparql11`](../sparql/sparql11).
